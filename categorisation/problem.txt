1 Problem statement
═══════════════════

  We want to categorise various e-commerce products into a multilevel
  category tree.  The product categories are useful when we want to do
  market projections, our daily operations need it when deciding on
  allowed routes (certain items like active power sources, or liquids,
  are not airworthy), etc.


2 Data
══════

  We have provided product titles along with their top level categories.
  Product titles can be found in product_title.txt, while label.txt
  contains the corresponding numeric representations of the categories.


3 Goal
══════

  The aim of this assignment is to implement a classifier (something
  that you can do in half a week) which if given a new product title,
  can predict the category of the new product (confidence scores, etc
  are optional).  You are free to use any open source tool or library in
  any language, however, if you use Python, or R, evaluating your
  solution is easier for us; Java or C++ is also fine.  If you may make
  assumptions in your solution, we expect you to justify them.

  Apart from the code, you are expected to write a report on all the
  steps necessary to solve the problem (not limited to your
  implementation above, but in a more general scope), including
  pre-processing of data and other transformations.  You may also
  include other possible approaches for solving the product
  categorisation problem along with the pros and cons of each approach
  you mention.

  As a second part of the problem, we expect you to propose ways how we
  can extend the solution to multilevel categorisation.  Please discuss
  this proposal in some detail in your report.
